				<p>Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth. It’s the only Earth’ permanent natural satellite. Moon is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System.</p>
				<p>The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. It’s average orbital distance is 384,402km. This distance is about thirty times the diameter of the earth.</p>
				<p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to earth, the near side. The near side is marked by dark volcanic Maria that fills the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters.</p>

				<h2>Moon Phases</h2>
				<p>Phases of moon are the no. of different Moon looks from the Earth over about a month.As the Moon orbits around the Earth, the half of the Moon that faces the Sun will be lit up because of which the different shapes of the Moon that can be seen from Earth are known as phases of the Moon. Each phase repeats itself every 29.5 days.</p>
				<h2>Physical Characteristics of Moon</h2>
				<p>The Moon is a differentiated body: it has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 km (150 mi). A fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 km (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km (310 mi).</p>
				<h2>Gravitational Field</h2>
				<p>The gravitational field of the Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascon’s, large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.</p>
				<h2>Magnetic field</h2>
				<p>The Moon has an external magnetic field of about 1–100 nT, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. The Moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization, probably acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating.</p>
