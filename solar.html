				<h2>What is Solar Power ??</h2>
				<p>Solar Power is the conversion of Sunlight into Energy so that we can use it. This conversion is done in many ways:- directly using Photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using Concentrated Solar Powers.</p>
				<h2>Photovoltaics :- </h2>
				<p>This system employs Solar Panels, each comprising a number of Solar Cells, which generate electrical power. Photovoltaics installations can be done either Ground-Mounted, Rooftop Mounted or Wall Mounted.</p>
				<h2>Advantages of Photovoltaics:-</h2>
				<p> It’s Operation does not generate any Pollution, NO Green House Gas Emission, Silicon has large availability in Earth Crust.</p>
				<p>Photovoltaics systems have the major Disadvantage that the Power Output works best with direct sunlight, so about 10-25% is lost if a tracking system is not used. Dust, Clouds and other Obstructions in the Atmosphere also diminish the power output.</p>
				<h2>Concentrated Solar Powers:-</h2>
				<p>This system generate Solar Power by using Mirrors or Lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight or Solar Thermal Energy onto a small area. Electricity is generated when concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a Heat Engine connected to an Electrical Power Generator.</p>
				<p>Concentrated Solar Powers  had a world’s total installed capacity of 4,815 MW in 2016, up from 354 MW in 2005.</p>
				<p>Advantage of Concentrated Solar Powers over Photovoltaics is that as a Thermal Technology, running a conventional Thermal Power Block. A Concentrated Solar Powers plant can store the heat of solar energy in Molten Salts. These molten salts enables these plants to continue to generate electricity whenever it is needed, whether day or night.</p>
				<p>Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of Electricity for Small and Medium-sized applications. From the Calculator powered by a single Solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop Photovoltics system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. </p>
				<p>The current largest Photovoltaic Power Station in the World is the 850 MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park in Qinghai, China.</p>
				<p>Hybrid System:- Hybrid system combines Photovoltic and Concentrated Solar Cells with one another. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of Non Renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on Islands.</p>
