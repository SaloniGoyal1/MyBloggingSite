				<p>In our Solar System Rings of Saturn are the Most Extensive Ring system of any Planet. They consists of Countless Particles of different Size that Orbits around Saturn. These Ring Particles are made almost entirely of Water ice, with the Trace component Rock Materials.</p>
				<p>Reflection from these Rings increases the Brightness of Saturn Planet, but these are not visible from the Earth with unaided vision. In 1610, Galileo Galilei was the first person to observe these Rings of Saturn, although he could not see them well enough. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens was the first person to describe them as a Rings surrounding Saturn.</p>
				<p>These Rings have numerous gaps where particle Density Drops Sharply: two opened by known moons embedded within them, Other Gaps remains unexplained. On the other hand Stabilizing Resonance, are responsible for Longevity of Several Rings, such as Titan Ringlet and G Ring.</p>
				<p>The Main Ring is a Phoebe Ring, which is presumed to be originated from Phoebe. It is Aligned to the Plane of Saturn’s Orbit. Saturn has an Axial tilt of 27 degrees, so this ring is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the more visible rings orbiting above Saturn’s equator.</p>
				<h2>Physical Characteristics of Rings</h2>
				<p>The dense main rings extend from 7,000 km to 80,000 km away from Saturn’s equator, whose radius is 60,300 km. With an estimation thickness ranging from 10 m to 1 km, they are composed of 99% pure Water ice with a Smattering of Impurities that may include Particles of Tholins and Silicates. These particles have the size Ranging from 1 cm to 10 m.</p>
				<p>According to Voyger observations it is estimated that total Mass of these Rings are about 3 × 1019 kg. The largest gaps in the rings, such as the Cassini Division and Encke Gap, can be seen from Earth, both Voyager spacecraft discovered that the rings have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. Some gaps are cleared out by the passage of tiny moonlets such as Pan, many more gaps may yet be discovered.</p>
				<p>Data from the Cassini space probe indicate that the rings of Saturn possess their own atmosphere, independent of that of the planet itself. The atmosphere is composed of molecular Oxygen gas (O2) produced when UV light from the Sun interacts with water ice in the rings. Chemical reactions between water molecule fragments and further ultraviolet stimulation create and eject, among other things. According to models of this atmosphere, H2 is also present.</p>
