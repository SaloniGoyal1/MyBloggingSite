				<h2>What is Solar Eclipse?</h2>
				<p>Solar Eclipse occurs when the moon passes in a direct line between the Earth and the Sun. This can only happen during New Moon when the Moon is close to the Ecliptic Plane. The disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon.</p>
				
				<h2>How Solar Eclipse Occur??</h2>
				<p>In Case of Partial and Annular Eclipses only the part of Sun is obscured. Solar Eclipse only occur during Eclipse Seasons resulting in at least two and up to 5 solar eclipses each years, no more two of which are total eclipsed. Total Eclipses are very Rare because of the timing of the New Moon. Solar Eclipse is an Natural Phenomenon.</p>
				<p>At the Time of Solar Eclipse looking directly at the Sun can causes sometimes permanent eye damage or Blindness. Special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse.</p>
				<p>The Sun’s distance from the Earth is 400 times the Moon’s distance. The Sun’s diameter is about 400 times the Moon’s diameter. </p>

				<h2>Types of Solar Eclipse:</h2>
				<p> <b>Total Eclipse :- </b> It occurs when the Dark Silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun,  allowing the much fainter solar Corona to be visible. </p>
				<p> <b>Annular Eclipse :- </b> It occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with the Earth, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring. </p>
				<p> <b>Partial Eclipse :- </b> It  occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse.</p>
				<p>Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable because of the sun’s brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all.</p>
				<p><b>The Moon’s shadow has two parts:</b>  Central Region (umbra) and Outer Region (penumbra).</p>
				<p>If the Umbra passes over you, the entire central portion of the sun will be blocked out. You will see Total Solar Eclipse, and the sky will darken as if it were night time. During a Total Solar Eclipse, you can see the sun’s outer atmosphere, called the Corona. </p>
