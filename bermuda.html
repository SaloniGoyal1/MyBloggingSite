				<h2>Other Name of Bermuda Triangle??</h2>
				<p>The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil’s Triangle or Hurricane Alley.</p>
				<h2>Area of Bermuda Triangle</h2>
				<p>In 1964, Vincent Gaddis wrote in the pulp magazine Argosy of the boundaries of the Bermuda Triangle.  By giving its vertices as Miami, San Juan, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. The Total area varying from 1,300,000 to 3,900,000 km2 (500,000 to 1,510,000 sq mi).</p>
				<h1>Some Natural Expansions in the Region of Bermuda Triangle</h1>
				<h2>Compass Variation</h2>
				<p>At the time you enter the Bermuda Region Magnetic Compass don’t show the direction. It’s Pin start rotating in all directions and you were not able identify the path in that region.</p>

				<p>The Gulf Stream is a major surface current, primarily driven by Thermohaline circulation. That originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the Straits of Florida into the North Atlantic. It is a River inside the ocean. It has a maximum surface velocity of about 2m/s(6.6ft/s).</p>
				<h2>Human Error</h2>
				<h2>Violent Weather</h2>
				<p> Hurricanes are powerful storms that form in tropical waters. These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle.</p>
				<h2>Methane Hydrates</h2>
				<p>An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of Methane Hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the Continental shelves. It has been hypothesized that periodic Methane Eruptions (sometimes called “mud volcanoes“). It may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate buoyancy for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.</p>
				<h2>Some Incidents of Bermuda Triangle</h2>
				<h2>Ellen Austin</h2>
				<p>Ellen Austin supposedly came across a Derelict Ship. It is placed on board a prize crew and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared, some elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew. Then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board.</p>
				<h2>USS Cyclops</h2>
				<p>This incident result’s in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy. It is not related to combat occurred when the collier Cyclops, carrying a full load of Manganese Ore and with one engine out of action. It went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of Barbados.</p>
				<h2>Carroll A. Deering</h2>
				<p>Schooner Carroll A. Deering, as seen from the Cape Lookout light vessel on January 29, 1921, two days before she was found deserted in North Carolina. (US Coast Guard)</p>
				<h2>Flight 19</h2>
				<p>Flight 19 was a training flight of five TBM (Avenger torpedo bombers) that disappeared on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron’s flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale for 141 mi (227 km), north for 73 mi (117 km), and then back over a final 140-mile (230-kilometre) leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base.</p>
				<h2>Star Tiger and Star Arial</h2>
				<p>G-AHNP Star Tiger disappeared on January 30, 1948, on a flight from the Azores to Bermuda. G-AGRE Star Ariel disappeared on January 17, 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to Kingston, Jamaica. Both were Avro Tudor IV passenger aircraft operated by British South American Airways.</p>
