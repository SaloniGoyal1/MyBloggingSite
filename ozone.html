				<p>Ozone Layer or Ozone Shield or Ozonosphere, it is in the region of the upper Atmosphere. It is Present in Layer Stratosphere, from approximately 50 km (31 mi) above Earth. It absorbs most of the Sun’s Ultraviolet Radiations  (mainly wavelength of UV Radiation is less than 310 nm).</p>
				<p>Ozone Layer Contain’s relatively high concentrations of Ozone molecules (O3). Ozone layer contains less than 10 ppm(parts per million) of ozone. The average ozone concentration in Earth’s atmosphere as a whole is about 0.3 ppm(parts per million). The Thickness of this layer is extending from 10–18 km (6–11 miles).</p>
				<p>Ozone Layer was discovered in year 1913 by French Physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. The ozone layer absorbs 97 to 99 percent of the Sun’s medium-frequency UV light (from about 200 nm to 315 nm Wavelength).</p>
				<p>Concerns that increased UV radiation due to Ozone Depletion threatened life on Earth. It leads to increased skin cancer in humans and other ecological problems. It led to bans on the chemicals and the latest evidence is that ozone depletion has slowed or stopped.</p>
				<p>The United Nations General Assembly has designated September 16 as the International Day of Prevention of Ozone Layer.</p>
				<h2>Advantages of Photovoltaics:-</h2>
				<p> It’s Operation does not generate any Pollution, NO Green House Gas Emission, Silicon has large availability in Earth Crust.</p>
				<p>Photovoltaics systems have the major Disadvantage that the Power Output works best with direct sunlight, so about 10-25% is lost if a tracking system is not used. Dust, Clouds and other Obstructions in the Atmosphere also diminish the power output.</p>
				<h2>Sources of Ozone Layer</h2>
				<p>Ozone in the Earth’s stratosphere is created when UV Light strikes ordinary Oxygen Molecules (O2) contains two atoms of Oxygen. Splitting them into individual oxygen atoms (atomic oxygen). The atomic oxygen then combines with unbroken O2 to create ozone, O3. The ozone molecule is unstable. When Ultraviolet light hits ozone it splits into a molecule of O2 and an individual atom of oxygen. In form of Chemical Equation:</p>
				<p>O2 + ℎνuv → 2 O</p><p>O + O2 ↔ O3</p>
				<h2>Ultraviolet Light</h2>
				<p>UV Radiation are capable of Penetrating Nitrogen is divided into 3 Categories. These are:- UV-A , UV-B and UV-C .</p>
				<p>Ozone is transparent to most UV-A(400–315 nm), so most of this longer wavelength UV radiation reaches the surface. It constitutes most of the UV reaching the Earth. This type of UV radiation is significantly less harmful to DNA, although it may cause Physical Damage, Premature aging of the Skin, Indirect Genetic Damage and Skin Cancer.</p>
				<p>UV-B (315–280 nm) radiation can be harmful to the skin and is the main cause of Sunburn. It is excessive exposure can also cause cataracts, immune system suppression and genetic damage, resulting in problems such as Skin Cancers.</p>
				<p>UV-C(280–100 nm), which is very harmful to all living things, is entirely screened out by a combination of Dioxygen (< 200 nm). </p>
				<h2>Depletion</h2>
				<p>Ozone Layer can be depleted by free radical catalysts. It also Including Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydroxyl (OH), Atomic Chlorine (Cl) and Atomic Bromide (Br).</p>
				<p>Highly stable compounds are capable of surviving the rise to the Stratosphere. Where Cl and Br radicals are liberated by action of UV light. Each radical is then free to initiate and catalyze a chain reaction capable of breaking down over 100,000 ozone molecules. By 2009, Nitrous oxide was the largest Ozone-Depleting Substance (ODS) emitted through human activities.</p>
				<p>The breakdown of Ozone in the Stratosphere results in reduced absorption of UV radiation. Consequently, Unabsorbed and Dangerous UV radiation is able to reach the Earth’s surface at a higher intensity. Ozone levels have dropped by a worldwide average of about 4 % since the late 1970’s. For approximately 5 % of the Earth’s surface, around the North and South Poles, much larger seasonal declines have been seen called “Ozone Holes”.</p>
